# Challenge 2 - Kirby Land

For this challenge, we created four different Kirby's along with their own Kirby Land for them to live on!

## Kirby _!_

### Original Kirby
We first decided to make a prefab of Kirby's body to serve as a base model. This prefab consisted of three 3D objects in total, a sphere for the body, and two small capsules embedded in the middle surface of the sphere for the character’s eyes.
In order to make the prefab, we started off by making the model in the sample scene of Unity:
1. Game Object > 3D Object > Sphere - We scaled the sphere to a size we were satisfied with as the body of Kirby.

2. Game Object > 3D Object > Capsule - Scaled it small enough to serve as the eyes.

3. Duplicate the capsule and position it beside the other with some space in between.

With the model created, in the "Hierarchy" menu, we dragged each capsule into the sphere and then dragged the sphere onto a prefab folder created within assets. Additionally, we changed the names of each object according to the body part they represent.

For easier and quicker development on this project, we created four different prefab variants for our Kirby's. After our original prefab was completed, we used it to make prefab variants from it by right clicking the original kirby prefab > prefab > create > prefab variant. Once in the prefab mode of each variant, it allowed us to easily edit each Kirby since the body was already completed and ready to be used.

Due to the lengthy project, we decided to divided our kirby's and their land into seperate files for easier navigation and access! You can also click each link down below for a quick look:

## Kirby Memories _!_
The first time I ever saw Kirby was early 2000’s when the game ‘Kirby Air Ride’ came out for the Nintendo console ‘GameCube’. My brother and I would always visit our grandmother’s house after school and played together all day until our parent’s picked us up (or until I got tired of losing). I’m not sure how I even came by it, my parents probably bought the game as a gift seeing the cute character on the cover. It wasn’t my favorite game at the time, but I really liked Kirby due to how adorable he was and eventually became my go to character in future games when he was featured. Until this day, I still appreciate Kirby, it became a huge part of my childhood to me as well as my brother’s, and even if we don’t play Kirby related games anymore, I know we will forever cherish our memories of the character and the joy it brought us back then.

As much as I loved playing games since I was a kid, I never got to experience playing a single game of the Kirby franchise until sometime in university. When GameStop was still around, I remember being interested in buying Kirby’s Epic Yarn, but I made the mistake of listening to my older sister when she told me it would be too much of a hard game. So, my main experiences with Kirby came from Super Smash Bros instead. Although it was not the main fighter I would play as, he was still a super fun and beginner friendly character. As mentioned prior I did eventually play some levels of Kirby Super Star to have some experience. Overall, I found it simplistic but fun, although I haven’t completed it yet. Eventually, I would also like to play Kirby’s Epic Yarn since my young past self didn’t get to.

The first Kirby game I played was Kirby Super Ultra Star on my pink DSi. It was a gift I received for Christmas and I became immediately obsessed. I played all the levels several times even after beating the game, and I would restart a new file just for the fun of it. I tried getting my sisters to play it too, they liked the game fairly enough but they couldn't understand why I was so into the game. Looking back, while the gameplay was great, I definitely think what drew me in were the aesthetics of the game. At the time they were so interesting and satisfying to me I was enthralled. While I do appreciate today's modern graphics I find that the pixelated art for these games has such a charming aspect. I still have a DSi and play this game once in a while for nostalgia and in my opinion it holds up despite its age. In my opinion Kirby super Ultra Star is still a top tier Kirby game.

## Experienced Gained:
Thanks to this project, I managed to think outside the box, looking for different, creative ways on how to implement our Kirby’s with the limited shapes we’ve learned so far. It was definitely a challenge but one I truly enjoyed and had fun making. Through trial and error, along with patience, our Kirby's made it through as well as the land! This challenge helped me in understanding the view and complexity of things, like how to properly proportion Kirby's hands and feet to his body, making it correctly scaled and positioned accordingly, as well as the details of how the shapes overlap with each other to create new better objects. The detailing with the terrain truly helped as well to better understand how to seamlessly create a world aiming for accuracy and realism. Overall, this project helped me enhance and further better my skills in Unity as well allow me a creative output for it which I thoroughly enjoyed.

I really appreciated having to make Kirby despite not having much of an attachment as others. Because it is a well-known and loved character, it made me excited to work on this project. Having to figure out how to make the details of the model was challenging at first but it kept me entertained all throughout. Once I finished, I was looking forward to seeing the Kirby variants my other teammates were making. As always, seeing the final result is incredibly rewarding. For the terrain, I made the mistake of not elevating it prior to adding the mountains so I wasn't able to create trenches where rivers would be, but this was a lesson learned that I will apply to future projects. In the end, this project has aided me in getting used to the different aspects and tools Unity provides and taking advantage of the few shapes currently available in a more creative way.

I decided to take the task of mainly creating two of the four Kirby's. I was pretty excited for this challenge initially because firstly, two of my favorite games are from the Kirby franchise. Secondly, I would get to use some of my artistic skills to try to make these models look as accurate as possible. I tried not to overestimate myself and picked Kirby variations that had simple elements. I still had quite the challenge as someone who can be a perfectionist when it comes to art. Deciding what available 3D objects I could use to create other forms or shapes was not easy with the limited selection, but that was also what made it fun. Sometimes I like doing art with unlikely methods or limited tools cause it forces you to make more creative choices. In the end I have a much better understanding of prefabs and variation models. I'm also particularly happy with how our models ended up looking.
