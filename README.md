# Challenge 2 - Kirby Land

For this challenge, we created four different Kirby's along with their own Kirby Land for them to live on!

## Kirby Variants:

### Original Kirby - (aqui va el body original de kirby)


For easier and quicker development on this project, we created four different prefab variants for our Kirby's. After our original prefab was completed, 
we used it to make prefab variants from it by right clicking the original kirby prefab > prefab > create > prefab variant. Once we are inside the each variant, it will allow us easy control on each with the body already completed and ready to be used.
