### Cleaning Kirby
- This variant is composed of multiple parts, the hands/feet, a broom, a headpiece, and dust particles. Here are the following steps we took to recreate this character.

### Broom:
- Starting off with the broom, we first took a 3D capsule and scaled its size accordingly until we ended up with a long and thin shape resembling a broom stick.

- For the brush cap that holds the bristles of a broom, we took another capsule, rotated it to a 90-degree angle, shortened the length, and flattened the width. Then we inserted the broom stick in the center as shown in the image below.

- Lastly, for the bristles, we took a 3D cube and scaled it down to a small rectangular shape thin enough to fit part of it inside the brush cap. Additionally, we angled the cube a bit to simulate the sweeping motion.

- After having the design of the broom made, we positioned it alongside the base of our Kirby.
Note: Some adjustments were made to the size of the broom to better fit the size of the base.

### Hands:
- By having the broom in place, we were able to proceed with creating Kirby’s arms. Starting off with the right hand, we took another capsule, rotated it to a 90-degree angle and scaled it down a bit. We then positioned it to the side of Kirby, slightly below the eyes and angled it to our preference where the backend of the capsule is inside Kirby’s body and made sure that the frontend made contact with the broom stick. This way it looks as if Kirby is holding the broom.

- Similarly for the left hand, we duplicated the right arm and positioned it at the opposite side, below the eyes and angled it to our preference where it looks as if Kirby were to be reaching and touching the brush cap of the broom.

### Eyes:
- Before proceeding with Kirby’s feet, we also moved and angled the eyes roughly between the hands to present a more dynamic look to the pose.

### Feet:
- Moving on to Kirby’s feet, we first took a capsule rotated it to a 90-degree angle and scaled up the size, making sure that it was bigger than the capsules used for the hands. We also flattened the width, similarly to how we did it previously for the brush cap, but wider. This capsule became the left foot of our Kirby by placing it on the left side of Kirby and diagonal the left hand. This odd position simulates Kirby lifting his foot.

- Then we duplicated the left foot capsule and placed it below Kirby’s body towards the right in a flatter position. This way he is standing on his right foot.

- Backside:

### Headpiece:

- For the headpiece, we first took another sphere and placed it within the body of the Kirby and adjusted the position where it pops out a bit from the top of his body like the following image.

- The outline that shows up will then be the outline for the border of the bandana. We took a cylinder object and scaled down acrooss the y-axis to form a thin disc. This disc was then placed on the outline between each sphere.

- Next came the tied part of the headpiece, where we first took a new capsule and flattened the width, like how it was done prior with the feet. We made sure that the end of the capsule was inserted at the back of the headpiece and that it was long enough to be visible from the front.

- Frontside:

- Then we duplicated the capsule and reflected it.

- Finally, we created another capsule and scaled it down to the size of the intersection between each end of the knot to represent the actual knot.

### Dust:
- Lastly, for this Kirby, we decided to add an optional detail, dust. This dust was simply made by clustering together different sizes of spheres. In our case, two clusters were enough to complete the final look.

### Result:
