### Sword Kirby body
To create our Sword Kirby we will need to create hands, feet, a hat, and a sword. We will start with simplest components and finish with the most complex. First, using the rotate tool we are going to tilt our prefab Kirby's body on the z-axis so his body is leaning slightly to the right. 

This will be our base:

### Kirby's hands
The hands are composed of two capsules. Create a capsule object and scale to a larger size. Width-wise they should be larger than the eyes. The left hand will hold the sword therefore this hand will be place on the lower left side of the body. Attach the the capsule to the body until ony a round looking shape is sticking out, this will be the hand.

These are the values for refrence:

-Right hand
For the right hand duplicate the first capsule. This hand will be holding on to the hat so it doesn't fly away mid battle. Move and rotate the second capsule pointing upward on the right side of the body. At this stage it should look like Kirby is waving hello.

### Kirby's feet
For this variant Kirby will look like he is running. To create the feet we will also use two capsules. For the left foor, this will be the one that is behind the body pushing kirby forward. First place and adjust a capsule object to a larger size flattening slightly.
