To create our Fighter Kirby we will need to create a variety of elements using 3D objects, such as the hands, feet, bandana, and small details, like the eyebrows and star. 
First, using the rotate tool we are going to tilt our prefab Kirby's body on the z-axis so his body is leaning to the left. Next tilt the body downwards slightly. 

He should look something like this:

### Kirby’s hands
For Kirby's hands we will be using capsules. To place create the object go to the GameObject tab >> 3D Object >> Capsule. Once our capsule is placed we can begin adjucting it to form the lower left hand. Enlarge the capsule using the scale tool and rotate to about these values:

So far:

For the upper right hand we will copy the left hand by right-clicking and duplicating. Using the move tool place the right hand above Kirby's body. Adjust by rotating.

### Kirby’s feet
For the feet we will also be using two capsule objects. In this pose Kirby is standing on his tippy toes and kicking with the other foot. Starting with the left foot that he is standing create a capsule and scale to a larger size, flattening it slightly. Similar to a flipper but without loosing too much roundness. Move and rotate the capsule to fit under Kirbys body, connected to the base, pointing downwards.

Duplicate the first capsule to create right foot that is kicking. Move and rotate to place on the right upper part of his body, about eyelevel. Increase the size of the capsule using scale tool to create a cartoony effect of cartoony of coming towards us.

### Kirby’s bandana
For the bandana place a cylinder object. Using the scle tool flatten to about the size of his eyes. Scale the cylinder to fit the perimeter of the top of Kirby's head (It's okay if it touches his hands! That is the correct placement).

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 9 19 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3856954b-701f-4b22-8155-5908410e0702">

Kirby's bandana has two strips of fabric flowing from behind. To create these place a cube object and flatten to create a logn thin rectangle. Duplicate this object and stratigecally tilt and place both strips on the back of the bandana in such a way that still shows from the front. 

Back view:

Note: If the strips do not show from the fron they may not be long enough!

### Finishing Details (Eyebrows & Star)
For the eyebrows create a capsule and shrink until small and skinny, like a toothpick. Place the capsule above kirbys eye slightly covering the top of his eye to create a more angry look. Duplicate capsule and repeat for other eye.

For the finishing touch create the star tha goes on the bandana.
First create a sphere as the base and flatten it. Create another sphere object and place inside the first sphere creating a folder for our star. Flatten and scale the new spere into a almost pill-like shape to be one of the edges of the star. Duplicate this object four times to create five edges. Move and rotate every "edge" to connect to our base until a satisfactory star is formed.

Once the star is done place on top of the bandana.

Done!
