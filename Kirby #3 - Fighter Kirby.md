To create our Fighter Kirby we will need to create a variety of elements using 3D objects, such as the hands, feet, bandana, and small details, like the eyebrows and star. 
First, using the rotate tool we are going to tilt our prefab Kirby's body on the z-axis so his body is leaning to the left. Next tilt the body downwards slightly. 

He should look something like this:

### Kirby’s hands
For Kirby's hands we will be using capsules. To place create the object go to the GameObject tab >> 3D Object >> Capsule. Once our capsule is placed we can begin adjucting it to form the lower left hand. Enlarge the capsule using the scale tool and rotate to about these values:

So far:

For the upper right hand we will copy the left hand by right-clicking and duplicating. Using the move tool place the right hand above Kirby's body. Adjust by rotating.

### Kirby’s feet

For the feet we will also be using two capsule objects. In this pose Kirby is standing on his tippy toes and kicking with the other foot. Starting with the left foot that he is standing create a capsule and scale to a larger size, flattening it slightly. Similar to a flipper but without loosing too much roundness. Move and rotate the capsule to fit under Kirbys body, connected to the base, pointing downwards.

Duplicate the first capsule to create right foot that is kicking. Move and rotate to place on the right upper part of his body, about eyelevel. Increase the size of the capsule using scale tool to create a cartoony effect of cartoony of coming towards us.
