To create our Fighter Kirby we will need to create a variety of elements using 3D objects, such as the hands, feet, bandana, and small details, like the eyebrows and star. 
First, using the rotate tool we are going to tilt our prefab Kirby's body on the z-axis so his body is leaning to the left. Next tilt the body downwards slightly. 

He should look something like this:
