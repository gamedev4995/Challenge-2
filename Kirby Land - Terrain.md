## Kirby Land - Terrain
Before beginning with the terrain, we chose the following image of the heightmap of Puerto Rico. This is what we based on when shaping the landscape.

Once the terrain is created from the Game Object > 3D Object > Terrain menu, we set the mesh resolution to 250 width x 250 length x 250 height and the texture resolution to 256x256.

Then we began shaping the terrain by creating the area of the mountains in the original image using brush number 6 with a brush size of 45 and an opacity of 31.

This was the result:

We then went in with brush number 4, with the same size and opacity, to elevate the mountains and make them more pronounced.

This was the result:

Lastly, we went in with brush number 4 again but this time with a size of 25 and an opacity of 10 to level the plains/river areas of the terrain and remove the flatness it originally had.
